            <strong>Shaping My Tech Journey: From Skills to Impact</strong>
            <br><br>
            As a final-year Computer Science Engineering student, my academic journey has been driven by a strong foundation in programming, hands-on project development, and a passion for solving real-world problems using technology.
            <br><br>
            I’ve developed a range of skills in C, C++, JavaScript, and Python, along with experience in tools like MySQL, MATLAB, and libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. These skills were applied in projects like <em>Real-time Plant Health Monitoring</em>—an AI-powered system for detecting plant leaf diseases using deep learning models—and <em>NeoMom360</em>, a pregnancy care platform built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for improving maternal health access.
            <br><br>
            Beyond academics, my role as Coordinator of the Creative Arts Committee enhanced my leadership, collaboration, and event planning skills. My active involvement in the NCC further built qualities of discipline, time management, and resilience—traits I apply in both team settings and independent challenges.
            <br><br>
            I aim to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry by working on impactful solutions in areas like health, security, and sustainability. I am particularly interested in front-end development, AI-powered platforms, and full-stack opportunities where I can continue to grow as a developer and problem-solver.
            <br><br>
            With a blend of technical skills, practical experience, and leadership exposure, I am excited to take the next step into the professional world—ready to learn, adapt, and add value from day one.❤
